DATA STRUCTURE - mechanism allowing us to organize our data for easy manipulation in an application.
The data structures are Lists, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set.

A. Lists
- characteristics
1. mutable, 2. allows duplicate values, 3. ordered, 4. indexed, 5. written with square brackets

- to chnage a value - eg. students[0] = "Brandon"
- to add another value - eg. students.append("Rashida")
- to remove a value - eg. students.pop[1]

'''
students = ["Max", "Magy", "Rashida", "Muthoni", "Raph", "Ali"]
print(students)
students[0] = "Brandon"
print(students)
students.append("Rashida")
print(students)
students.pop(2)
print(students)
